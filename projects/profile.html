    <h1>Aloha! My name is Myron Spencer Nacar!</h1>
    <p>
        I came from the beautiful islands of the Philippines.
        I came here to Brigham Young University-Hawaii with my wife and daughter and I am currently taking up Information Technology as my major here.
        I am enjoying and loving my studies here so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        My interests include photograpy, playing basketball, running, and watching tech videos.
        I even have created a dedicated instagram page to showcase my photography.
        I also love computers and technology. I keep myself updated with ongoing tech and gadgets through tech videos on youtube. 
        Outside of school and work, I am father and husband who enjoys spending time with his family. Whether that be walking together on campus, having picnics on the beach, or having a simple dinner at home.
