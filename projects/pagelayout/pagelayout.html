                    <span class="cola">Coca-Cola</span> was invented by a pharmacist named <span class="bold">John Stith Pemberton</span> in Atlanta, Georgia. Orginally, it was intended to be a medicinal tonic and was sold at soda fountains. 
                    Coca-Cola was first sold in bottles in 1899 and in 1915, the iconic contour bottle design is introduced and is still used today. The original formula of Coca-Cola includes cocal leaf extract, which contained small amounts of cocaine, and kola nut extrac, which contained caffeine, hence the name <span class="bold">"Coca-Cola."</span>  However, in 1904, cocained was removed from the formula. Wew!
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="bold">Frank M. Robinson</span>, John Pemberton's bookkeeper, actually suggested the name "Coca-Cola" and is also responsible for the design of the iconic script logo that the brand still uses today. The Coca-Cola logo is written in a style called Spencerian Script, which was a popular form of penmanship in the 19th century and is commonly used for business correspondence. This elegant script looks decorative and added to the appeal of the brand.
