    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a global network that connects billions of devices and allows users to communicate and access information. Through the internet, we are able to use email, instant messaging, video conferencing, and more.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Web</strong> is a system of interconnected web pages that are accessible through the internet.</p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>While the <em><strong>Internet</strong></em> is a global network that connects a vast network of computers around the world, the <em><strong>Web</strong></em> is a system of interconnected web pages accessible through the internet. I think of it like this, the Internet is like the roads and highways that connects us from place to place and the Web is like the cars that run through those roads and highways.  </p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>Both the <em><strong><abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr></strong></em> and the <em><strong><abbr title="Universal Character Encoding">Unicode</abbr></strong></em> are character encoding standards that are used to represent computer language to the English language. </p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p>The <em><strong>UTF-8</strong></em> is a character encoding standard that translates Unicode characters into a sequence of bytes. The UTF-8 is preferable because of its backward compatibility with ASCII and it uses less memory. </p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p><em><strong>URL</strong></em> stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Simply put, a URL is a location or address of a unique resource found on the internet. It refers to a specific page on a certain website. </p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>A <em><strong>Domain Name</strong></em> is the name of a website. For example, "google.com" is the domain name for the Google website.  </p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>The <em><strong><abbr title ="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr></strong></em> is a set of rules that allows web clients and servers to be able to communicate with each other.</p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p><p>The <em><strong><abbr title ="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr></strong></em> is a secure version of the HTTP. It is still a set of rules that allows communication web clients and servers however, HTTPS encrypts the data sent to protect both the connection and the data.</p></p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>An <em><strong><abbr title ="Internet Protocol Address">IP Address</abbr></strong></em> is a unique string of characters that identifies each computer or device that communicates over the internet or a network.</p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>A <em><strong><abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr></strong></em> is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses. I think of DNS like a phone book that translates name into a phone number on your phone. DNS does the exact the same except it translates a Domain Name into an IP Address.</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>The <em><strong><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">WC3</abbr></strong></em> is an international non-profit organization that develops standards or guidelines that promotes consistency and interoperability on the web. It publishes recommendations that are considered to be web standards. These recommendations help developers and organization create reliable, consistent, and accessible web pages that are compatible across different browsers.</p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>The <em><strong>XML</strong></em> is primarily designed to store and transport data. It focuses on the structure of the data rather than how it's displayed. It is strictly well-formed and case-sensitive. 
        <br><br>The <em><strong>XHTML</strong></em> is a hybrid between HTML and XML. It brings the strictness of XML to HTML for web documents. It is a little less flexible that HTML due to its strict rules. It is focused on both structure and presentation, like HTML
        <br><br>The <em><strong>HTML</strong></em> is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. It focuses on the structure of web content. It has looser syntax compared to XML and XHTML.
        <br><br>The <em><strong>HTML5</strong></em> is the latest and most poweful version of HTML. It is designed for modern web development and has introduced new features for multimedia, API's, and mobile friendliness. Its syntax is similar to HTML but has enhanced semantics that provide better structure to web page content.</p>
