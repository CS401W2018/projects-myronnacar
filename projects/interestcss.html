        <h2 class="emphasize">Street Photography</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="bolder">Street Photography is a genre of photography that captures candid moments and everyday scenes in public spaces, usually urban environment.</span>
            It can feature anything from bustling city streets to quient overlooked details. 
            It typically emphasizes a photographer's ability to notice and frame such scenes in an artistic way. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="emphasize ">Why Street Photography?</h2>
        <p>
            I love street photography because it allows me to capture raw and authentic moments of everyday life.
            It allows me to express my creativity and share unique perspectives through composition, light and shadows, and subject choice.
            Another thing I love about it is that, you don't need a professional camera to get started with street photography; I use my mobile phone to capture these kinds of shots.

        <h3 class="deemphasize">About Links</h3>
        <p class="deemphasize">
            An Absolute Link contains the entire url of a website we want the link to point to. 
            It includes the protocol, domain name,and the path to where the website is stored in the web server.
            We usually use the absolute link to view a website that is not our own.
            <br><br>
            A Relative Link only contains a portion of url, usually just the name of the html file.
            We use a relative link when we like to view a web page that is of our own.
