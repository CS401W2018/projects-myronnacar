            <p>
                <span class="bold">1. What is the difference between block tags and inline tags? Give examples of each one.</span>
                <br>
                -Block tags starts on a new line and takes up the full width available while inline tags, as the name implies, display content within the same line as surrounding text. One example of a block tag is the header tag. One example of line tag is the anchor link tag.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">2. What is normal flow in HTML?</span>
                <br>
                -The normal flow in HTML is the way that block and inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. Top to bottom, left to right. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">3. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</span>
                <br>
                -It places an element on left or right side of its container allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">4. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</span>
                <br>
                -Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to it first position.
                -Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window. It does not move, hence it's fixed.
                Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">5. How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</span>
                <br>
                -We are able to make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices by placing the link under a UL tag.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">6. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</span>
                <br>
                -You can find it in Canvas, under Lecture Notes - Css and Box Model.
