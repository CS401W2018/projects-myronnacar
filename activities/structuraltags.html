    <h2>Engagement Questions</h2>
    <h4>What goes in the header?</h4>
    <p>Usually an H1 tag. The header does not change. It stays the same on every page.</p>
    <h4>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does Nav contain links to another website?</h4>
    <p>Links go inside the Nav tag. The Nav can go in the header but it does not have to go in the header. It can be placed outside of the header too. The Nav tag contain links to other pages or other parts within your own web page.</p>
    <h4>What goes in Main?</h4>
    <p>the Main is where the main content of your page is going to go.</p>
    <h4>What goes in the Footer?</h4>
    <p>Usually we put our copyright in the footer. Privacy and Legal notices also go in the footer. Cookie preference also go in the footer. Address and Contact is also good to put in the footer and other helpful links.</p>
    <h4>HTML Validation</h4>
