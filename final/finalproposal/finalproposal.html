            <h2>Title and Topic</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Frames by Myron</h3>
                This is a working title. My final project would be a photography portfolio website showcasing photos taken with my phone, proving that creativity is more important than gear.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Why I Chose This Topic</h2>
                I chose this topic because I wanted to showcase my mobile photography portfolio. Additionally, as a beginner photographer, I rely on my phone to explore and develop my skills. This website will show that anyone can create beautiful images with tools they already have and that they don't have to buy expensive gear to start their passion for photography.
